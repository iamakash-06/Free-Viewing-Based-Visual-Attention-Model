# Dataset

The above files are the dataset that we have used for our project. The dataset is in the form of videos with heat map overlay. These videos visually encapsulated the areas of heightened visual attention, marked by a dynamic circle illustrating the trajectory of usersâ€™ gaze points during their interaction with web content.
